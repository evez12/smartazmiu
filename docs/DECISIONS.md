## D-001 · 2026-10-24 · Example typo in Azerbaijani normalization spec

- **Context:** §5.7.1 illustrated diacritic-insensitive matching with `Ekonomik riyaziyyat ↔ Ekonomik riyaziyyat` (identical strings).
- **Options:** keep as is; replace with an example that actually differs in diacritics.
- **Decision:** example changed to `İqtisadi riyaziyyat ↔ Iqtisadi riyaziyyat` in the spec; `normalize_az` tests use it.
- **Consequences:** none beyond the test case.

## D-002 · 2026-10-24 · Primary key for `channel_reads`

- **Context:** §5.7 defines `channel_reads(channel_id, user_id, last_read_message_id, updated_at)` without a key.
- **Options:** surrogate id + unique index; composite primary key.
- **Decision:** `PRIMARY KEY (channel_id, user_id)`; read-marker writes are upserts that only move the marker forward.
- **Consequences:** one row per member per channel; concurrent tabs cannot move the marker backwards.

## D-003 · 2026-10-24 · Exam mode for subject communities

- **Context:** `exam_slots` belong to a `course_offering`, but a `subject_community` spans every offering (all groups) of the subject.
- **Options:** never lock communities; lock during any offering's exam slot (union of intervals); lock per group.
- **Decision:** the community is read-only (no attachments) during the union of all exam windows
  (`starts_at − 15 min → ends_at`) of every offering of that subject in the current semester. Overlaps merge, per §13.4.
- **Consequences:** communities may be locked for several separate windows in an exam session; the banner shows the
  current window's end time. Staff can still configure exam mode per subject (§5.2).

## D-004 · 2026-10-24 · Mentor requests without a named mentor

- **Context:** §5.2 allows `mentor_id = NULL` ("any eligible guide"), but the create guard checks the mentor's
  availability and `max_open_requests`, which cannot be evaluated without a mentor.
- **Options:** forbid NULL mentor; evaluate the guard at create time against all guides; defer the guard.
- **Decision:** when `mentor_id` is NULL the availability/capacity guard is skipped at creation and applied at
  `accept` to the accepting guide (inside the same row-locked transaction). The other create guards still apply.
- **Consequences:** an unaddressed request can be accepted only by an eligible, available guide below capacity.

## D-005 · 2026-10-24 · Authentication architecture (Keycloak + Next.js + FastAPI)

- **Context:** §4 requires Keycloak OIDC, a 15-minute JWT access token and a refresh token in an httpOnly cookie;
  §5.9 requires single-use WebSocket tickets; §14 requires CSRF protection for cookie-authenticated mutations.
- **Options:** browser-side OIDC (tokens in JS); backend-for-frontend (BFF) where the Next.js server runs the
  authorization-code + PKCE flow.
- **Decision:** BFF. The Next.js server performs the OIDC flow, keeps the refresh token in an encrypted httpOnly,
  `Secure`, `SameSite=Lax` cookie, and forwards the short-lived access token to FastAPI. FastAPI validates JWTs against
  Keycloak's JWKS (issuer, audience, expiry). WebSockets authenticate with a 60-second single-use ticket from
  `POST /api/v1/ws/ticket`. Mutating requests that rely on the session cookie carry a CSRF token.
- **Consequences:** no long-lived tokens are reachable from page JavaScript; FastAPI stays stateless for REST auth.

## D-006 · 2026-10-24 · Snowflake worker IDs with multiple API workers

- **Context:** `messages.id` is a snowflake BIGINT; several uvicorn workers and ARQ workers generate IDs.
- **Options:** static worker IDs from config; random IDs; leased IDs from Redis.
- **Decision:** each process leases a worker ID from Redis (`SET NX` with TTL, renewed periodically) at startup.
  The generator is monotonic within a process and refuses to issue IDs while the clock moves backwards.
- **Consequences:** Redis is required at API startup; ID-uniqueness and clock-regression behaviour is unit-tested (§13.2).

## D-007 · 2026-10-24 · Where visual regression tests run

- **Context:** §16 requires Playwright screenshot tests; font rendering differs between Windows and Linux, so
  baselines produced on the Windows dev box would fail in CI.
- **Options:** per-OS baselines; run screenshot tests only in the official Linux Playwright Docker image.
- **Decision:** visual regression runs only inside the pinned Linux Playwright image (locally via `make` and in CI).
  Functional E2E tests may run natively.
- **Consequences:** one set of baselines; updating baselines requires Docker.

## D-008 · 2026-10-24 · Phase 0 (discovery & design)

- **Context:** Phase 0 consists mostly of human activities (interviews, surveys, Figma, stakeholder sign-off).
- **Options:** block engineering on Phase 0; proceed with engineering and record technical ADRs.
- **Decision:** engineering starts at Sprint 1. The technical ADRs listed in Phase 0 are written in `docs/adr/` as
  the relevant code lands. Non-engineering Phase 0 items remain unticked for the product owner.
- **Consequences:** UI follows §12 directly instead of a Figma design system until one exists.

## D-009 · 2026-10-24 · Local development environment

- **Context:** Windows 11 dev box; the original folder name contained a non-ASCII `İ`, which breaks some Python,
  Node and Docker tooling. `make` and `pnpm` were not installed.
- **Options:** everything in Docker; everything native; infra in Docker with native app processes.
- **Decision:** repo lives at the ASCII path `C:\Users\User\Projects\smartazmiu`. Infra services (postgres, redis,
  minio, keycloak, mailpit) run in Docker Compose; `api` and `web` run natively during development. `make up` still
  starts the full stack (including `api`, `web`, `nginx`) in Docker. A single GNU `Makefile` (winget
  `ezwinports.make` 4.4.1) is the only task runner. JavaScript package manager: pnpm 12.15.0.
- **Consequences:** Makefile recipes must work in both Git Bash on Windows and Linux CI.

## D-010 · 2026-10-24 · Data sources not yet available

- **Context:** no roster file, schedule source format or information about an existing AzMİU identity provider.
- **Options:** wait; build against realistic synthetic data and local identity.
- **Decision:** use realistic made-up Azerbaijani seed data (groups like `765a2`, real-looking names, subjects,
  rooms) and local Keycloak test users. Import formats are designed as documented CSV/XLSX templates and adapted
  once real files arrive.
- **Consequences:** import adapters may need changes when real source formats are provided.

## D-011 · 2026-10-24 · Commit trailers

- **Context:** product owner instruction.
- **Decision:** commits and PR descriptions never include `Co-Authored-By` or "Generated with" trailers.
- **Consequences:** none.
